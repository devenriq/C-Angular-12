        It has been made the layout of the details of the destination travels
        using Figma. That was about the description of the places which will be
        visited, the start point, the end point, the duration of the travel and
        it's cost. Besides, I worked on linking the JSON file with the details
        section giving it interactivity like refreshing the page every time a
        user select a destination. This feature gave to the user a complete
        interaction with the interface switching between all of the possible
        different destinations.
